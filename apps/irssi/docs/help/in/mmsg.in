MMSG [<-sign>] [<-channel>] <target> <file> [<type>  [<encoding>]]

Sends a private data message to other user in the network.  The message
will be send as a MIME encoded data message.

If -channel option is provided then this command actually send channel
message to the specified channel.  The message IS NOT private message, it
is normal channel message.

If the -sign optin is provided, the message will be additionally
signed.

Messages that exceed roughly 64k have to be split up into smaller packets.
This is done automatically.

If no transfer-encoding is given it defaults to binary or 7bit for messages
that have to be split up.

If no content-type is given it is guessed using a MIME magic file.

NOTE: You have to have enabled perl support at compile time, and you need to
load the perl script silc-mime.pl for this to work!
