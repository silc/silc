@SYNTAX:smsg@

Sends a signed private message to other user in the network.
The message will be digitally signed and the receiver may verify
the message by using your public key.

If -channel option is provided then this command actually
send channel message to the specified channel.  The message
IS NOT private message, it is normal channel message.  Also this
message will be signed and can be verified by using your public
key.

The default theme of Irssi SILC Client shows the digital signed
messages with [S] at start of the nickname who sent the message, when
the message was successfully verified, [?] if the message could not
be verified since the public key of the sender isn't cached locally,
or [F] if the signature verificationn failed.  If you do not have
the sender's public key you can fetch it with GETKEY command.

If you do want to verify the signatures from received messages
you may do /SET ignore_messages_signatures on.  In this case
signatures in messages are ignored and they appear as normal
non-signed messages.  By default, all message signatures are
verified.

Examples:

/SMSG Foobar Very authenticated message
/SMSG -channel silc Another signed message
/SMSG * I truly said this
