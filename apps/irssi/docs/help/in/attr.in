@SYNTAX:attr@

In SILC it is possible to retrieve detailed information about a user
with WHOIS command by giving -details option to the WHOIS.  This
information is retrieved directly from the client, if the client
supports it.  This process is called as handling a Requested Attributes 
in WHOIS.  If client does not support attributes or do not want to send
anything then server may reply on behalf of the client.

You may set your personal information that others may retrieve using
WHOIS command.  These information is set with ATTR command. By default, 
in SILC Client sending the information is allowed.  If you do not want to 
allow it give command:

    ATTR allow OFF

and your client will not reply to the requests.  This usually means that
server may not send you the request anymore at all, or may do so only
occasionally.

Adding new information is done with ATTR command as follows:

    ATTR <option> { <value>}

If the <option> already has a value the new value will replace the old
value.  Deleting all added information for a option is done as follows:

    ATTR -del <option>
