ROBODoc  Version 3.2.3 May 2001.

ROBODoc is program documentation tool. The idea is to include for
every function or procedure a standard header containing all
sorts of information about the procedure or function.  ROBODoc
extracts these headers from the source file and puts them in a
separate autodocs-file.  ROBODoc thus allows you to include the
program documentation in the source code and avoid having to
maintain two separate documents.  Or as Petteri puts it: "robodoc
is very useful - especially for programmers who don't like
writing documents with Word or some other strange tool."

ROBODoc can format the headers in a number of different formats:
HTML, ASCII, AmigaGuide, LaTeX, or RTF. In HTML mode it can
generate cross links between headers. You can even include parts
of your source code.

ROBODoc works with many programming languages: For instance C,
Pascal, Shell Scripts, Assembler, COBOL, Occam, Postscript,
Forth, Tcl/Tk, C++, Java -- basically any program in which you
can use remarks/comments.
