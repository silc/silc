V3.2.3  o Bug fix. The crosslink generator did not recognize links that
          contained a '/' and ended with an '.' or ','.
        o make install  installs additional documentation.

V3.2.2  o Added a Master Index File for LaTeX output.  
        o New NOSOURCE option to exclude source items from the documentation.
        o New SINGLEDOC option to all documentation to be included into one
          single document.
        o New TITLE option to set the title for a master index file.
          example make files includes commands to view the
          generated documentation.
        o Made the search for remark markers case insensitive.  So you
          can use REM and Rem or even rEM.

V3.2.1  Some small bugfixes, support for mailto:... links, and updates
in the manual.
