1. Introduction

This document describes a Packet Protocol used in the Secure Internet
Live Conferencing (SILC) protocol specified in the Secure Internet Live
Conferencing, Protocol Specification Internet Draft [SILC1].  This
protocol describes the packet types and packet payloads which defines
the contents of the packets.  The protocol provides secure binary packet
protocol that assures that the contents of the packets are secured and
authenticated.

The basis of SILC protocol relies in the SILC packets and it is with
out a doubt the most important part of the protocol.  It is also probably
the most complicated part of the protocol.  Packets are used all the
time in the SILC network to send messages, commands and other information.
All packets in SILC network are always encrypted and their integrity
is assured by computed MACs.  The protocol defines several packet types
and packet payloads.  Each packet type usually has a specific packet
payload that actually defines the contents of the packet.  Each packet
also includes a default SILC Packet Header that provides sufficient
information about the origin of the packet and destination of the
packet.

2.1 SILC Packet

SILC packets deliver messages from sender to receiver securely by
encrypting important fields of the packet.  The packet consists of
default SILC Packet Header, Padding, Packet Payload data, and, packet 
MAC.

The following diagram illustrates typical SILC packet.

Figure 1:  Typical SILC Packet


SILC Header is always the first part of the packet and its purpose
is to provide information about the packet.  It provides for example
the packet type, origin of the packet and the destination of the packet.
The header is variable in length and first two (2) bytes of the
header (thus first two bytes of the packet) are not encrypted.  The
first two (2) bytes are the length of the packet which is not encrypted.
See the following section for description of SILC Packet header.  Packets
without SILC header or with malformed SILC header MUST be dropped.

Padding follows the packet header.  The purpose of the padding is to
make the packet multiple by eight (8) or by the block size of the
cipher used in the encryption, which ever is larger.  The maximum
length of padding is currently 16 bytes.  The padding is always
encrypted.

Data payload area follows padding and it is the actual data of the
packet.  The packet data is the packet payloads defined in this
protocol.  The data payload area is always encrypted.

The last part of SILC packet is the packet MAC that assures the
integrity of the packet.  The MAC is always computed from the packet
before the encryption is applied to the packet.  If compression is used
in the packet the MAC is computed after the compression has been
applied.  The compression, on the other hand, is always applied before
encryption.  See more details in the section 2.6 Packet MAC Generation.

All fields in all packet payloads are always in MSB (most significant
byte first) order.


.ti 0
2.2 SILC Packet Header

The SILC packet header is applied to all SILC packets and it is
variable in length.  The purpose of SILC Packet header is to provide
detailed information about the packet.  The receiver of the packet
uses the packet header to parse the packet and gain other relevant
parameters of the packet.

The following diagram represents the SILC packet header.  (*) indicates
that this field is never encrypted.  Other fields are always encrypted.

o Payload Length (2 bytes) - Is the length of the packet
  not including the padding of the packet.  This field must
  not be encrypted but must always be authenticated.

o Flags (1 byte) - Indicates flags to be used in packet
  processing.  Several flags may be set by ORing the flags
  together.

  The following flags are reserved for this field:


     No flags                  0x00

       In this case the field is ignored.


     Private Message Key       0x01

       Indicates that the packet must include private
       message that is encrypted using private key set by
       client.  Servers does not know anything about this
       key and this causes that the private message is
       not handled by the server at all, it is just
       passed along.  See section 2.5.3 Private Message
       Encryption And Decryption for more information.


     List                      0x02
  
       Indicates that the packet consists of list of
       packet payloads indicated by the Packet Type field.
       The payloads are added one after the other.  Note that
       there are packet types that must not be used as
       list.  Parsing of list packet is done by calculating
       the length of each payload and parsing them one by
       one.


     Broadcast                 0x04

       Marks the packet to be broadcasted.  Client cannot
       send broadcast packet and normal server cannot send
       broadcast packet.  Only router server may send broadcast
       packet.  The router receiving of packet with this flag 
       set MUST send (broadcast) the packet to its primary
       route.  If router has several router connections the
       packet may be sent only to the primary route.  See
       section 2.12 Packet Broadcasting for description of 
       packet broadcasting.

o Packet Type (1 byte) - Is the type of the packet. Receiver 
  uses this field to parse the packet.  See section 2.3
  SILC Packets for list of defined packet types.

o Source ID Length (2 bytes) - Indicates the length of the
  Source ID field in the header, not including this or any
  other fields.

o Destination ID Length (2 bytes) - Indicates the length of the
  Destination ID field in the header, not including this or
  any other fields.

o Src ID Type (1 byte) - Indicates the type of ID in the
  Source ID field.  See section 2.4 SILC ID Types for
  defined ID types.

o Source ID (variable length) - The actual source ID that
  indicates which is the original sender of the packet.

o Dst ID Type (1 byte) - Indicates the type of ID in the
  Destination ID field.  See section 2.4 SILC ID Types for
  defined ID types.

o Destination ID (variable length) - The actual destination
  ID that indicates which is the end receiver of the packet.

2.3 SILC Packet Types

SILC packet types defines the contents of the packet and it is used by
the receiver to parse the packet.  The packet type is 8 bits, as a one
byte, in length.  The range for the packet types are from 0 - 255,
where 0 is never sent and 255 is currently reserved for future
extensions and MUST NOT be defined to any other purpose.  Every SILC
specification compliant implementation SHOULD support all of these packet
types.

The below list of the SILC Packet types includes reference to the packet
payload as well.  Packet payloads are the actual packet, that is, the data
that the packet consists of.  Each packet type defines packet payload 
which usually may only be sent with the specific packet type.

Most of the packets are packets that must be destined directly to entity
that is connected to the sender.  It is not allowed, for example, for
router to send disconnect packet to client that is not directly connected
to the router.  However, there are some special packet types that may
be destined to some entity that the sender has not direct connection
with.  These packets are for example private message packets, channel
message packets, command packets and some other packets that may be
broadcasted in the SILC network.  If the packet is allowed to be sent to
indirectly connected entity it is mentioned separately in the packet
description (unless it is obvious as in private and channel message
packets).  Other packets MUST NOT be sent or accepted, if sent, to
indirectly connected entities.

List of SILC Packet types are defined as follows.

.in 1
     0    SILC_PACKET_NONE

          This type is reserved and it is never sent.         


     1    SILC_PACKET_DISCONNECT

          This packet is sent to disconnect the remote end.  Reason of
          the disconnection is sent inside the packet payload.  Client
          usually does not send this packet.

          This packet MUST NOT be sent as list and the List flag MUST
          NOT be set.

          Payload of the packet:  See section 2.3.3 Disconnect Payload


     2    SILC_PACKET_SUCCESS

          This packet is sent upon successful execution of some protocol.
          The status of the success is sent in the packet.

          This packet MUST NOT be sent as list and the List flag MUST
          NOT be set.

          Payload of the packet:  See section 2.3.4 Success Payload


     3    SILC_PACKET_FAILURE

          This packet is sent upon failure of some protocol.  The status
          of the failure is sent in the packet.

          This packet MUST NOT be sent as list and the List flag MUST
          NOT be set.

          Payload of the packet:  See section 2.3.5 Failure Payload


     4    SILC_PACKET_REJECT

          This packet MAY be sent upon rejection of some protocol.
          The status of the rejection is sent in the packet.

          This packet MUST NOT be sent as list and the List flag MUST
          NOT be set.

          Payload of the packet:  See section 2.3.6 Reject Payload


     5    SILC_PACKET_NOTIFY

          This packet is used to send notify message, usually from
          server to client, although it MAY be sent from server to another
          server as well.  Client MUST NOT send this packet.  Server MAY
          send this packet to channel as well when the packet is 
          distributed to all clients on the channel.

          Payload of the packet:  See section 2.3.7 Notify Payload.


     6    SILC_PACKET_ERROR

          This packet is sent when an error occurs.  Server MAY
          send this packet.  Client MUST NOT send this packet.  The
          client MAY entirely ignore the packet, however, server is
          most likely to take action anyway.  This packet MAY be sent
          to entity that is indirectly connected to the sender.

          This packet MUST NOT be sent as list and the List flag MUST
          NOT be set.

          Payload of the packet:  See section 2.3.8 Error Payload.


     7    SILC_PACKET_CHANNEL_MESSAGE

          This packet is used to send messages to channels.  The packet
          includes Channel ID of the channel and the actual message to
          the channel.  Messages sent to the channel are always protected
          by channel specific keys.  Channel Keys are distributed by
          SILC_PACKET_CHANNEL_KEY packet.

          This packet MUST NOT be sent as list and the List flag MUST
          NOT be set.

          Payload of the packet:  See section 2.3.9 Channel Message 
                                  Payload


     8    SILC_PACKET_CHANNEL_KEY

          This packet is used to distribute new key for particular
          channel.  Each channel has their own independent keys that
          is used to protect the traffic on the channel.  Only server
          may send this packet.  This packet MAY be sent to entity
          that is indirectly connected to the sender.

          This packet MUST NOT be sent as list and the List flag MUST
          NOT be set.

          Payload of the packet:  See section 2.3.10 Channel Key Payload


     9    SILC_PACKET_PRIVATE_MESSAGE

          This packet is used to send private messages from client
          to another client.  By default, private messages are protected
          by session keys established by normal key exchange protocol.
          However, it is possible to use specific key to protect private
          messages.  SILC_PACKET_PRIVATE_MESSAGE_KEY packet is used to 
          agree the key with the remote client.  Pre-shared key MAY be 
          used as well if both of the client knows it, however, it needs 
          to be agreed outside SILC.  See more of this in [SILC1].

          This packet MUST NOT be sent as list and the List flag MUST
          NOT be set.

          Payload of the packet:  See section 2.3.11 Private Message
                                  Payload


     10   SILC_PACKET_PRIVATE_MESSAGE_KEY

          This packet is used to agree about a key to be used to protect
          the private messages between two clients.  If this is not sent
          the normal session key is used to protect the private messages
          inside SILC network.  Agreeing to use specific key to protect
          private messages adds security, as no server between the two
          clients will be able to decrypt the private message.  However,
          servers inside SILC network are considered to be trusted, thus
          using normal session key to protect private messages does not
          degrade security.  Whether to agree to use specific keys by
          default or to use normal session keys by default, is 
          implementation specific issue.  See more of this in [SILC1].

          This packet MUST NOT be sent as list and the List flag MUST
          NOT be set.

          Payload of the packet:  See section 2.3.12 Private Message
                                  Key Payload


     11   SILC_PACKET_COMMAND

          This packet is used to send commands from client to server.
          Server MAY send this packet to other servers as well.  All
          commands are listed in their own section SILC Command Types
          in [SILC4].  The contents of this packet is command specific.
          This packet MAY be sent to entity that is indirectly connected
          to the sender.

          This packet MUST NOT be sent as list and the List flag MUST
          NOT be set.

          Payload of the packet:  See section 2.3.13 Command Payload


     12   SILC_PACKET_COMMAND_REPLY

          This packet is sent as reply to the SILC_PACKET_COMMAND packet.
          The contents of this packet is command specific.  This packet
          MAY be sent to entity that is indirectly connected to the
          sender.

          This packet MUST NOT be sent as list and the List flag MUST
          NOT be set.

          Payload of the packet:  See section 2.3.14 Command Reply 
                                  Payload and section 2.3.13 Command
                                  Payload


     13   SILC_PACKET_KEY_EXCHANGE

          This packet is used to start SILC Key Exchange Protocol, 
          described in detail in [SILC3].

          This packet MUST NOT be sent as list and the List flag MUST
          NOT be set.

          Payload of the packet:  Payload of this packet is described
                                  in the section SILC Key Exchange
                                  Protocol and its sub sections in
                                  [SILC3].

2.3.1 SILC Packet Payloads

All payloads resides in the main data area of the SILC packet.  However
all payloads MUST be at the start of the data area after the SILC
packet header and padding.  All fields in the packet payload are always
encrypted, as they reside in the data area of the packet which is
always encrypted.

Payloads described in this section are common payloads that MUST be
accepted anytime during SILC session.  Most of the payloads may only
be sent with specific packet type which is defined in the description
of the payload.

There are a lot of other payloads in the SILC as well.  However, they
are not common in the sense that they could be sent at any time. 
These payloads are not described in this section.  These are payloads
such as SILC Key Exchange payloads and so on.  These are described
in [SILC1], [SILC3] and [SILC4].

2.3.7 Notify Payload

Notify payload is used to send notify messages.  The payload is usually
sent from server to client, however, server MAY send it to another
server as well.  This payload MAY also be sent to a channel.  Client
MUST NOT send this payload.  The receiver of this payload MAY ignore
the contents of the payload, however, notify message SHOULD be audited.

The payload may only be sent with SILC_PACKET_NOTIFY packet.  It MUST
not be sent in any other packet type.  The following diagram represents
the Notify Payload.

The following list of currently defined notify types.  The format for
notify arguments is same as in SILC commands described in [SILC4]. 
Also, all ID's sent in arguments are sent inside ID Payload.

.in 6
0     SILC_NOTIFY_TYPE_NONE

      If no specific notify type apply for the notify message this type
      MAY be used.

      Max Arguments:  1
          Arguments:  (1) <message>

      The <message> is implementation specific free text string.
      Receiver MAY ignore this message.


1     SILC_NOTIFY_TYPE_INVITE

      Sent when an client is invited to a channel.  This is also sent
      when the invite list of the channel is changed.  This notify type
      is sent between routers and if an client was invited, to the 
      client as well.  In this case the packet is destined to the client.

      Max Arguments:  5
          Arguments:  (1) <Channel ID>          (2) <channel name>
                      (3) [<sender Client ID>]  (4) [<adding client>]

      The <Channel ID> is the channel.  The <channel name> is the name
      of the channel and is provided because the client which receives 
      this notify packet may not have a way to resolve the name of the
      channel from the <Channel ID>.  The <sender Client ID> is the
      Client ID which invited the client to the channel.  The <adding
      client> and the <removing client> indicates the added or removed
      client from the channel's invite list.  The format of the <adding
      client> and the <removing client> is defined in the [SILC4] with
      SILC_COMMAND_INVITE command.

      distribute this type only to the local clients on the channel and
      then send it to its primary router.  The router or server receiving
      the packet distributes this type to the local clients on the
      channel and broadcast it to the network.

      receiving the packet distributes this type to the local clients
      on the channel and broadcast it to the network.

      Max Arguments:  2
          Arguments:  (1) <Old Client ID>  (2) <New Client ID>

      Server ID as well when the router is enforcing channel mode
      change) of the entity which changed the mode.  The <mode mask>
      is the new mode mask of the channel.  The client can safely
      ignore the <cipher> argument since the SILC_PACKET_CHANNEL_KEY
      packet will force the new channel key change anyway.  The <hmac>
      argument is important since the client is responsible of setting
      the new HMAC and the hmac key into use.


8     SILC_NOTIFY_TYPE_CUMODE_CHANGE

      Sent when user mode on channel has changed.  This type MUST be
      sent only to the clients which is joined on the channel where

      This is sent by normal server to the client.  This can also be
      sent by router to other server to force the Channel ID change.
      The Channel ID MUST be changed to use the new one.  When sent
      to clients, this type MUST be sent only to the clients which is
      joined on the channel.

      Max Arguments:  2
          Arguments:  (1) <Old Channel ID>  (2) <New Channel ID>

      The <Old Channel ID> is the channel's old ID and the <New
      Channel ID> is the new one that MUST replace the old one.

      server and are thus quitting the SILC network also.  If the
      maximum number of arguments are reached another 
      SILC_NOTIFY_TYPE_SERVER_SIGNOFF notify packet MUST be sent.
      When this notify packet is sent between routers the Client ID's
      MAY be omitted.


12    SILC_NOTIFY_TYPE_KICKED

      Sent when a client has been kicked from a channel.  This is
      sent also to the client which was kicked from the channel.
      The client which was kicked from the channel MUST be removed
      from the channel.  This notify type is always destined to the

      also to the client which was killed from the network.  The client
      which was killed from the network MUST be removed from the network.
      This notify type is destined directly to the client which was
      killed and to channel if the client is on any channel.  The router
      or server receiving the packet distributes this type to the local
      clients on the channel and broadcast it to the network.

      Max Arguments:  2
          Arguments:  (1) <Client ID>  (2) [<comment>]

      The <Client ID> is the client which was killed from the network.

2.3.8 Error Payload

Error payload is sent upon error.  Error may occur in various
conditions when server sends this packet.  Client MUST NOT send this
payload but MUST be able to accept it.  However, client MAY
totally ignore the contents of the packet as server is going to
take action on the error anyway.  However, it is recommended
that the client takes error packet seriously.

2.3.9 Channel Message Payload

Channel messages are the most common messages sent in the SILC.
Channel Message Payload is used to send message to channels.  These
messages can only be sent if client has joined to some channel.
Even though this packet is the most common in SILC it is still
special packet.  Some special handling on sending and reception
of channel message is required.

Padding MUST be applied into this payload since the payload is
encrypted separately from other parts of the packet with the
channel specific key.  Hence the requirement of the padding.  
The padding SHOULD be random data.  The packet MUST be made
multiple by eight (8) or by the block size of the cipher, which
ever is larger.

The SILC header in this packet is encrypted with the session key
of the next receiver of the packet.  Nothing else is encrypted
with that key.  Thus, the actual packet and padding to be
encrypted with the session key is SILC Header plus padding to it
to make it multiple by eight (8) or multiple by the block size
of the cipher, which ever is larger.

Receiver of the the channel message packet is able to determine
the channel the message is destined to by checking the destination
ID from the SILC Packet header which tells the destination channel.
The original sender of the packet is also determined by checking
the source ID from the header which tells the client which sent
the message.

The payload may only be sent with SILC_PACKET_CHANNEL_MESSAGE packet.
It MUST NOT be sent in any other packet type.  The following diagram 
represents the Channel Message Payload.

(*) indicates that the field is not encrypted.

o Flags (2 bytes) - Includes the flags of the channel
  messages.  The flags can indicate a reason or purpose
  for the channel message.  Note that the Private Message
  Payload use these same flags for the same purpose.  The
  following flags are defined:

  0x0000  SILC_MESSAGE_FLAG_NONE

          No specific flags set.

  0x0001  SILC_MESSAGE_FLAG_AUTOREPLY

          This message is an automatic reply to an earlier
          received message.

  0x0002  SILC_MESSAGE_FLAG_NOREPLY

          There should not be reply messages to this
          message.

  0x0004  SILC_MESSAGE_FLAG_ACTION

          The sender is performing an action and the message
          is the indication of the action.

  0x0008  SILC_MESSAGE_FLAG_NOTICE

          The message is for example an informational notice
          type message.

  0x0010  SILC_MESSAGE_FLAG_REQUEST

          This is a generic request flag to send request
          messages.  A separate document should define any 
          payloads associated to this flag.

  0x0020  SILC_MESSAGE_FLAG_SIGNED

          This flag indicates that the message is signed
          with sender's private key and thus can be verified
          by the receiver using the sender's public key.  A
          separate document should define the detailed procedure
          of the signing process and any associated payloads
          of this flag.

  0x0040 - 0x0200 RESERVED

          Reserved for future flags

  0x0400 - 0x8000 PRIVATE RANGE

          Private range for free use.

o Message Length (2 bytes) - Indicates the length of the
  the Message Data field in the payload, not including any 
  other field.

o Message Data (variable length) - The actual message to
  the channel.

o Padding Length (2 bytes) - Indicates the length of the
  Padding field in the payload, not including any other
  field.

o Padding (variable length) - The padding that MUST be
  applied because this payload is encrypted separately from
  other parts of the packet.

o MAC (variable length) - The MAC computed from the
  Message Length, Message Data, Padding Length and Padding
  fields.  This protects the integrity of the plaintext
  channel message.  The receiver can verify from the MAC
  whether the message decrypted correctly.  Also, if more than
  one private key has been set for the channel, the receiver
  can verify which of the keys decrypted the message 
  correctly.  Note that, this field is encrypted and MUST
  be added to the padding calculation.

o Initial Vector (variable length) - The initial vector
  that has been used in packet encryption.  It needs to be
  used in the packet decryption as well.  What this field
  includes is implementation issue.  However, it is 
  RECOMMENDED that it would be random data or, perhaps,
  a timestamp.  It is NOT RECOMMENDED to use zero (0) as an
  initial vector.  This field is not encrypted.  This field
  is not included into the padding calculation.  Length
  of this field equals the cipher's block size.  This field
  is, however, authenticated.

2.3.10 Channel Key Payload

All traffic in channels are protected by channel specific keys.
Channel Key Payload is used to distribute channel keys to all
clients on the particular channel.  Channel keys are sent when
the channel is created, when new user joins to the channel and
whenever a user has left a channel.  Server creates the new
channel key and distributes it to the clients by encrypting this
payload with the session key shared between the server and
the client.  After that, client starts using the key received
in this payload to protect the traffic on the channel.

The client which is joining to the channel receives its key in the
SILC_COMMAND_JOIN command reply message thus it is not necessary to
send this payload to the entity which sent the SILC_COMMAND_JOIN
command.

Channel keys are cell specific thus every router in the cell have
to create a channel key and distribute it if any client in the
cell has joined to a channel.  Channel traffic between cell's
are not encrypted using channel keys, they are encrypted using
normal session keys between two routers.  Inside a cell, all
channel traffic is encrypted with the specified channel key.
Channel key should expire periodically, say, in one hour, in
which case new channel key is created and distributed.

The payload may only be sent with SILC_PACKET_CHANNEL_KEY packet.
It MUST NOT be sent in any other packet type.  The following diagram 
represents the Channel Key Payload.

2.3.11 Private Message Payload

Private Message Payload is used to send private message between
two clients (or users for that matter).  The messages are sent only
to the specified user and no other user inside SILC network is
able to see the message.  The message is protected by the session 
key established by the SILC Key Exchange Protocol.  However,
it is also possible to agree to use a private key to protect
just the private messages.  See section 2.3.11 Private Message
Key Payload for detailed description of how to agree to use
specific key.

If normal session key is used to protect the message, every server
between the sender client and the receiving client MUST decrypt the
packet and always re-encrypt it with the session key of the next
receiver of the packet.  See section Client To Client in [SILC1].

When private key is used to protect the message, servers between 
the sender and the receiver needs not to decrypt/re-encrypt the 
packet.  Section Client To Client in [SILC1] gives example of this
scheme as well.

The payload may only be sent with SILC_PACKET_PRIVATE_MESSAGE 
packet.  It MUST NOT be sent in any other packet type.  The following 
diagram represents the Private Message Payload.

2.3.15 Connection Auth Request Payload

Client MAY send this payload to server to request the authentication
method that must be used in authentication protocol.  If client knows 
this information beforehand this payload is not necessary to be sent.
Server performing authentication with another server MAY also send
this payload to request the authentication method.  If the connecting
server already knows this information this payload is not necessary
to be sent.

Server receiving this request MUST reply with same payload sending
the mandatory authentication method.  Algorithms that may be required
to be used by the authentication method are the ones already 
established by the SILC Key Exchange protocol.  See section Key
Exchange Start Payload in [SILC3] for detailed information.

  If any other type is found in this field the packet MUST be
  discarded and the authentication MUST be failed.

o Authentication Method (2 bytes) - Indicates the authentication
  method to be used in the authentication protocol.  The following
  authentication methods are defined:

     0    NONE        (mandatory)

  authentication method this field MUST be set to zero (0),
  indicating that receiver should send the mandatory 
  authentication method.  The receiver sending this payload
  to the requesting party, MAY also set this field to zero (0)

2.3.16 New ID Payload

New ID Payload is a multipurpose payload.  It is used to send newly 
created ID's from clients and servers.  When client connects to server
and registers itself to the server by sending SILC_PACKET_NEW_CLIENT
packet, server replies with this packet by sending the created ID for
the client.  Server always creates the ID for the client.

This payload is also used when server tells its router that new client
has registered to the SILC network.  In this case the server sends
the Client ID of the client to the router.  Similarly when router
distributes information to other routers about the client in the SILC
network this payload is used.  

Also, when server connects to router, router uses this payload to inform
other routers about new server in the SILC network.  However, every 
server (or router) creates their own ID's thus the ID distributed by 
this payload is not created by the distributor in this case.  Servers
create their own ID's.  Server registers itself to the network by
sending SILC_PACKET_NEW_SERVER to the router it connected to.  The case
is same when router connects to another router.

However, this payload MUST NOT be used to send information about new
channels.  New channels are always distributed by sending the dedicated
SILC_PACKET_NEW_CHANNEL packet.

Thus, this payload is very important and used every time when some
new entity is registered to the SILC network.  Client MUST NOT send this
payload.  Both client and server (and router) MAY receive this payload.

The packet uses generic ID Payload as New ID Payload.  See section
2.3.2.1 for generic ID Payload.


.ti 0
2.3.17 New Client Payload

When client is connected to the server, keys has been exchanged and
connection has been authenticated client MUST register itself to the 
server.  Client's first packet after key exchange and authentication 
protocols must be SILC_PACKET_NEW_CLIENT.  This payload tells server all
the relevant information about the connected user.  Server creates a new
client ID for the client when received this payload and sends it to the
client in New ID Payload.

This payload sends username and real name of the user on the remote host
which is connected to the SILC server with SILC client.  The server 
creates the client ID according the information sent in this payload.
The nickname of the user becomes the username sent in this payload.
However, client should call NICK command after sending this payload to
set the real nickname of the user which is then used to create new 
client ID.

The payload may only be sent with SILC_PACKET_NEW_CLIENT packet.  It
MUST NOT be sent in any other packet type.  The following diagram
represents the New Client Payload.

2.3.19 New Channel Payload

Information about newly created channel is broadcasted to all routers
in the SILC network by sending this packet payload.  Channels are
created by router of the cell.  Server never creates channels unless
it is a standalone server and it does not have router connection,
in this case server acts as router.  Normal server send JOIN command
to the router (after it has received JOIN command from client) which
then processes the command and creates the channel.  Client MUST NOT
send this packet.  Server may send this packet to a router when it is
announcing its existing channels to the router after it has connected
to the router.

The packet uses generic Channel Payload as New Channel Payload.  See
section 2.3.2.3 for generic Channel Payload.  The Mode Mask field in the
Channel Payload is the mode of the channel.

2.3.20 Key Agreement Payload

This payload is used by clients to request key negotiation between
another client in the SILC Network.  The key agreement protocol used
is the SKE protocol.  The result of the protocol, the secret key
material, can be used for example as private message key between the
two clients.  This significantly adds security as the key agreement
is performed outside the SILC network.  The server and router MUST NOT
send this payload.

The sender MAY tell the receiver of this payload the hostname and the
port where the SKE protocol is running in the sender's end.  The 
receiver MAY then initiate the SKE negotiation with the sender.  The
sender MAY also optionally not to include the hostname and the port
of its SKE protocol.  In this case the receiver MAY reply to the
request by sending the same payload filled with the receiver's hostname
and the port where the SKE protocol is running.  The sender MAY then
initiate the SKE negotiation with the receiver.

This payload may be sent with SILC_PACKET_KEY_AGREEMENT and 
SILC_PACKET_FTP packet types.  It MUST NOT be sent in any other packet
types.  The following diagram represents the Key Agreement Payload.

2.3.22 File Transfer Payload

File Transfer Payload is used to perform file transfer protocol
between two entities in the network.  The actual file transfer
protocol is always encapsulated inside the SILC Packet.  The actual
data stream is also sent peer to peer outside SILC network.

When an entity, usually a client wishes to perform file transfer
protocol with another client in the network, they perform Key Agreement
protocol as described in the section 2.3.20 Key Agreement Payload and
in [SILC3], inside File Transfer Payload.  After the Key Agreement
protocol has been performed the subsequent packets in the data stream
will be protected using the new key material.  The actual file transfer
protocol is also initialized in this stage.  All file transfer protocol
packets are always encapsulated in the File Transfer Payload and
protected with the negotiated key material.

The payload may only be sent with SILC_PACKET_FTP packet.  It MUST NOT
be sent in any other packet type.  The following diagram represents the
File Transfer Payload

2.5 Packet Encryption And Decryption

SILC packets are encrypted almost entirely.  Only small part of SILC
header is not encrypted as described in section 5.2 SILC Packet Header.
The SILC Packet header is the first part of a packet to be encrypted
and it is always encrypted with the key of the next receiver of the
packet.  The data payload area of the packet is always entirely 
encrypted and it is usually encrypted with the next receiver's key.
However, there are some special packet types and packet payloads
that require special encryption process.  These special cases are
described in the next sections.  First is described the normal packet
encryption process.


.ti 0
2.5.1 Normal Packet Encryption And Decryption

Normal SILC packets are encrypted with the session key of the next
receiver of the packet.  The entire SILC Packet header and the packet
data payload is is also encrypted with the same key.  Padding of the
packet is also encrypted always with the session key, also in special
cases.  Computed MAC of the packet must not be encrypted.

Decryption process in these cases are straightforward.  The receiver
of the packet MUST first decrypt the SILC Packet header, or some parts
of it, usually first 16 bytes of it.  Then the receiver checks the
packet type from the decrypted part of the header and can determine
how the rest of the packet must be decrypted.  If the packet type is
any of the special cases described in the following sections the packet
decryption is special.  If the packet type is not among those special
packet types rest of the packet can be decrypted with the same key.

Also, note that two bytes of the SILC Packet header are not encrypted
thus it must be noticed in the decryption process by starting the
decryption from the second byte of the header.  This sets some rules
to padding generation as well, see the section 2.7 Packet Padding
Generation.

With out a doubt, this sort of decryption processing causes some
overhead to packet decryption, but never the less, is required.


.ti 0
2.5.2 Channel Message Encryption And Decryption

Channel Messages (Channel Message Payload) are always encrypted with
the channel specific key.  However, the SILC Packet header is not 
encrypted with that key.  As in normal case, the header is encrypted
with the key of the next receiver of the packet, who ever that might
be.  Note that in this case the encrypted data area is not touched
at all; it MUST NOT be re-encrypted with the session key.

Receiver of a channel message, who ever that is, is REQUIRED to decrypt
the SILC Packet header to be able to even recognize the packet to be as
channel message.  This is same procedure as for normal SILC packets.
As the receiver founds the packet to be channel message, rest of the
packet processing is special.  Rest of the SILC Packet header is
decrypted with the same session key along with the padding of the
packet.  After that the packet is protected with the channel specific
key and thus can be decrypted only if the receiver is the client on
the channel.  See section 2.7 Packet Padding Generation for more
information about padding on special packets.

If the receiver of the channel message is router which is routing the
message to another router then it MUST decrypt the Channel Message
payload.  Between routers (that is, between cells) channel messages
are protected with session keys shared between the routers.  This
causes another special packet processing for channel messages.  If
the channel message is received from another router then the entire
packet, including Channel Message payload, MUST be encrypted with the
session key shared between the routers.  In this case the packet
decryption process is as with normal SILC packets.  Hence, if the
router is sending channel message to another router the Channel
Message payload MUST have been decrypted and MUST be re-encrypted
with the session key shared between the another router.  In this
case the packet encryption is as with any normal SILC packet.

It must be noted that this is only when the channel messages are sent
from router to another router.  In all other cases the channel
message encryption and decryption is as described above.  This
different processing of channel messages with router to router
connection is because channel keys are cell specific.  All cells have
their own channel keys thus the channel message traveling from one
cell to another MUST be protected as it would be any normal SILC
packet.

If the SILC_CMODE_PRIVKEY channel mode has been set for the channel
then the router cannot decrypt the packet as it does not know the
private key.  In this case the entire packet MUST be encrypted with
the session key and sent to the router.  The router receiving the
packet MUST check the channel mode and decrypt the packet accordingly.


.ti 0
2.5.3 Private Message Encryption And Decryption

By default, private message in SILC are protected by session keys.
In this case the private message encryption and decryption process is
equivalent to normal packet encryption and decryption.

However, private messages MAY be protected with private message key
which causes the packet to be special packet.  The procedure in this
case is very much alike to channel packets.  The actual private message
is encrypted with the private message key and other parts of the
packet is encrypted with the session key.  See 2.7 Packet Padding
Generation for more information about padding on special packets.

The difference from channel message processing is that server or router
en route never decrypts the actual private message, as it does not
have the key to do that.  Thus, when sending packets between router
the processing is same as in any other case as well; the packet's header
and padding is protected by the session key and the data area is not
touched.

The true receiver of the private message, client, that is, is able
to decrypt the private message as it shares the key with the sender
of the message.


.ti 0
2.6 Packet MAC Generation

Data integrity of a packet is protected by including a message
authentication code (MAC) at the end of the packet.  The MAC is computed
from shared secret MAC key, that is established by the SILC Key Exchange
protocol, from packet sequence number, and from the original contents
of the packet.  The MAC is always computed before the packet is
encrypted, although after it is compressed if compression is used.

The MAC is computed from entire packet.  Every bit of data in the packet,
including SILC Packet Header is used in the MAC computing.  This way
the entire packet becomes authenticated.

If the packet is special packet MAC is computed from the entire packet
but part of the packet may be encrypted before the MAC is computed.
This is case, for example, with channel messages where the message data
is encrypted with key that server may not now.  In this case the MAC
has been computed from the encrypted data.

Hence, packet's MAC generation is as follows:

  mac = MAC(key, sequence number | SILC packet)

The MAC key is negotiated during the SKE protocol.  The sequence number
is a 32 bit MSB first value starting from zero for first packet and
increasing for subsequent packets, finally wrapping after 2^32 packets.
The value is never reset, not even after rekey has been performed.

See [SILC1] for defined and allowed MAC algorithms.


.ti 0
2.7 Packet Padding Generation

Padding is needed in the packet because the packet is encrypted.  It
MUST always be multiple by eight (8) or multiple by the block size
of the cipher, which ever is larger.  The padding is always encrypted.

For normal packets the padding is added after the SILC Packet Header
and between the Data Payload area.  The padding for normal packets
are calculated as follows:

.in 6
padding length = 16 - ((packet length - 2) mod 16)
.in 3

The 16 is the maximum padding allowed in SILC packet.  Two (2) is 
subtracted from the true length of the packet because two (2) bytes
is not encrypted in SILC Packet Header, see section 2.2 SILC Packet
Header.  Those two bytes that are not encrypted MUST NOT be calculated
to the padding length.

For special packets the padding calculation MAY be different as special
packets may be encrypted differently.  In these cases the encrypted
data area MUST already be multiple by the block size thus in this case
the padding is calculated only for SILC Packet Header, not for any
other area of the packet.  The same algorithm works in this case as
well, except that the `packet length' is now the SILC Packet Header
length.  In this case, as well, two (2) is subtracted from the
length.

The padding MUST be random data, preferably, generated by 
cryptographically strong random number generator.


.ti 0
2.8 Packet Compression

SILC Packets MAY be compressed.  In this case the data payload area
is compressed and all other areas of the packet MUST remain as they
are.  After compression is performed for the data area, the length
field of Packet Header MUST be set to the compressed length of the
data.

The compression MUST always be applied before encryption.  When
the packet is received and decrypted the data area MUST be decompressed.
Note that the true sender of the packet MUST apply the compression and
the true receiver of the packet MUST apply the decompression.  Any
server or router en route MUST NOT decompress the packet.


.ti 0
2.9 Packet Sending

The sender of the packet MUST assemble the SILC Packet Header with
correct values.  It MUST set the Source ID of the header as its own
ID, unless it is forwarding the packet.  It MUST also set the Destination
ID of the header to the true destination.  If the destination is client
it will be Client ID, if it is server it will be Server ID and if it is
channel it will be Channel ID.

If the sender wants to compress the packet it MUST apply the
compression now.  Sender MUST also compute the padding as described
in above sections.  Then sender MUST compute the MAC of the packet.

Then sender MUST encrypt the packet as has been described in above
sections according whether the packet is normal packet or special
packet.  The computed MAC MUST NOT be encrypted.


.ti 0
2.10 Packet Reception

On packet reception the receiver MUST check that all fields in the
SILC Packet Header are valid.  It MUST check the flags of the
header and act accordingly.  It MUST also check the MAC of the packet
and if it is to be failed the packet MUST be discarded.  Also if the
header of the packet includes any bad fields the packet MUST be
discarded.

See above sections on the decryption process of the received packet.
 
The receiver MUST also check that the ID's in the header are valid
ID's.  Unsupported ID types or malformed ID's MUST cause packet
rejection.  The padding on the reception is always ignored.

The receiver MUST also check the packet type and start parsing the
packet according to the type.  However, note the above sections on
special packet types and their parsing.


.ti 0
2.11 Packet Routing

Routers are the primary entities in the SILC network that takes care
of packet routing.  However, normal servers routes packets as well, for
example, when they are routing channel message to the local clients.
Routing is quite simple as every packet tells the true origin and the
true destination of the packet.

It is still RECOMMENDED for routers that has several routing connections
to create route cache for those destinations that has faster route than
the router's primary route.  This information is available for the router
when other router connects to the router.  The connecting party then
sends all of its locally connected clients, servers and channels.  These
informations helps to create the route cache.  Also, when new channels
are created to a cell its information is broadcasted to all routers
in the network.  Channel ID's are based on router's ID thus it is easy
to create route cache based on these informations.  If faster route for
destination does not exist in router's route cache the packet MUST be
routed to the primary route (default route).

However, there are some issues when routing channel messages to group
of users.  Routers are responsible of routing the channel message to
other routers, local servers and local clients as well.  Routers MUST
send the channel message to only one router in the network, preferrably
to the shortest route to reach the channel users.  The message can be
routed into either upstream or downstream.  After the message is sent
to a router in the network it MUST NOT be sent to any other router in
either same route or other route.  The message MUST NOT be routed to
the router it came from.

When routing for example private messages they should be routed to the
shortest route always to reach the destination client as fast as possible.

For server which receives a packet to be routed to its locally connected
client the server MUST check whether the particular packet type is
allowed to be routed to the client.  Not all packets may be sent by
some odd entity to client that is indirectly connected to the sender.
See section 2.3 SILC Packet Types and paragraph about indirectly connected
entities and sending packets to them.  The section mentions the packets
that may be sent to indirectly connected entities.  It is clear that
server cannot send, for example, disconnect packet to client that is not
directly connected to the server.

Routers form a ring in the SILC network.  However, routers may have other
direct connections to other routers in the network too.  This can cause
interesting routing problems in the network.  Since the network is ring,
the packets usually should be routed into counter clock-wise direction,
or if it cannot be used then always clock-wise (primary route) direction.
Problems may arise when a faster direct route exists and router is routing
a channel messages.  Currently channel messages must be routed either
in upstream or downstream, they cannot be routed to other direct routes.
The SILC protocol should have a shortest path discovery protocol, and some
existing routing protocol, that can handle a ring network with other direct
routes inside the ring (hybrid ring-mesh network), MAY be defined to be
used with the SILC protocol.  Additional specifications MAY be written
on the subject.


.ti 0
2.12 Packet Broadcasting

SILC packets MAY be broadcasted in SILC network.  However, only router
server may send or receive broadcast packets.  Client and normal server
MUST NOT send broadcast packets and they MUST ignore broadcast packets
if they receive them.  Broadcast packets are sent by setting Broadcast
flag to the SILC packet header.

Broadcasting packets means that the packet is sent to all routers in
the SILC network, except to the router that sent the packet.  The router
receiving broadcast packet MUST send the packet to its primary route.
The fact that SILC routers may have several router connections can
cause problems, such as race conditions inside the SILC network, if
care is not taken when broadcasting packets.  Router MUST NOT send
the broadcast packet to any other route except to its primary route.

If the primary route of the router is the original sender of the packet
the packet MUST NOT be sent to the primary route.  This may happen
if router has several router connections and some other router uses
the router as its primary route.

Routers use broadcast packets to broadcast for example information
about newly registered clients, servers, channels etc. so that all the
routers may keep these informations up to date.

3 Security Considerations

Security is central to the design of this protocol, and these security
considerations permeate the specification.  Common security considerations
such as keeping private keys truly private and using adequate lengths for 
symmetric and asymmetric keys must be followed in order to maintain the   
security of this protocol.
